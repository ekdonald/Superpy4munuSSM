2013-07-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 2.1.3

	* Allow a missing MASS block, if an extra ignorenomass kw argument
	is passed to the readSLHA(File) functions.

	* Fix **kwargs passing from file read/write functions to the
	string read/write ones.

	* Add parsing robustness against unknown data section types,
	particularly the proposed XSECTION.

2013-05-31  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 2.1.2

	* Adding a reference to the arXiv paper in the package docstring
	and slhaplot help message.

2013-05-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 2.1.1

	* Layout tweak for decay ID code alignment in SLHA output.

	* Treat consecutive strings as a single value in SLHA entry parsing.

	* Improvements/fixes to repr vs. str and tuple-value output formatting.

2013-05-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 2.1.0

	* Adding multi-value support and refactoring Block value setting.

2013-04-29  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 2.0.0 with new Block API.

	* Adding a leading space to float formatting of positive numbers
	to improve alignment.

	* Clean-up of precision formatting in output.

	* Split writeSLHA implementation into distinct writeSLHA{Blocks,Decays}.

2013-04-28  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a dict arg (compatible with dict.update) to the Block
	constructor.

	* Adding Block.set_value(*args) and Block documentation.

	* Various fixes to ISAWIG output (and conversion to use new
	tuple-indexing on mixing matrices and single-value accessing on
	ALPHA).

	* Improved API for access to entries/values and single/multi-value
	state on Block.

2013-04-26  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Improved SLHA output formatting.

	* Adding direct entry access via the [] operator to the Block
	class's entries.

	* Converting entries storage to avoid recursion, by using tuples
	as dict keys if necessary.

	* Version 1.5.0, since the behaviour has significantly altered.

	* Preserving the ordering of blocks, decays, and their their
	contents if possible, using ordered dicts. Thanks to Anders
	Kvellestad for the suggestion.

2013-04-08  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 1.4.4

	* pyslha.py: Fix handling of particles with NaN widths (and decay
	channels with NaN BRs). Both are filled into the blocks in
	readSLHA(File) now, with None as the value for the invalid
	width/BR: test for correctness with e.g. 'myparticle.width is not
	None'. BR == NaN decays will be added if the ignorenobr arg ==
	False (the default). Thanks to Lukas Vanelderen for the report.

2012-11-16  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 1.4.2, 1.4.3

	* setup.py: Adding install_requires for tex2pix so that
	PyPI/easy_install/pip automatic dependency handling will work.

2012-03-19  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a naive --aspect-ratio option, but the output is not ideal.

2012-03-04  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 1.4.1

	* Adding the --include command line option, which allows
	user-customisable additions to the plot.

	* Version 1.4.0

	* Updated test script which can take the output formats as an optional argument.

	* Check for duplicates and unsupported formats in the format string.

	* Adding rendering support for JPEG and PS (as opposed to EPS) formats.

	* Changing format string behaviour to require comma separators.

2012-03-03  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 1.3.3

	* Fix pyslha.ParseError printout to be more helpful.

	* Version 1.3.2

	* Improving error handling if tex2pix cannot be found or the MASS
	block is missing in the spectrum file, and adding the
	pyslha.ParseError class.

	* Version 1.3.1

	* Fix LaTeX package checks for tikz an mathpazo by adding .sty to
	the searched-for package names.

	* Version 1.3.0

	* Test for presence of the mathpazo package before including it in
	the default preamble.

	* Converting rendering system to use the separate tex2pix
	library (which itself is based on the slhaplot rendering
	experience).

2011-10-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Version 1.2.9

	* Fixing decay style handling, thanks to a suggestion from John Conley.

2011-09-24  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Version 1.2.8

	* Adding a max mass cutoff for slhaplot: don't show particle lines
	or associated decays for particles with masses greater than the
	cutoff. This is set to 10 TeV by default, i.e. above realistic LHC
	scales and was really introduced to protect the plotting code
	against Planck scale gravitons.

2011-09-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Version 1.2.7 (I'm not sure what happened to the ChangeLog
	reports for 1.2.{4,5,6}...)

	* slhaplot: Fixing the min/max x/y functions in the class used to
	implement label merging. Thanks to Alexander Mann for the bug
	report, patch, and test spectrum!

2011-06-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* pyslha.py: Add "precision" arguments to the write* functions,
	with default FP precision set to ".8" as suggested by Diego
	Restrepo.

2011-04-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* slhaplot: Add a warning about lack of provided decays if decays
	should be drawn, but none have been found in the input file.

	* Version 1.2.3.

	* Fix insufficiently careful parsing of BLOCK "Q=" declarations.

	* Add little pre-release testing script, "test".

	* Add missing IDHW / IDPDG mapping for W+- and Z0.

2011-03-13  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Version 1.2.2: use a more dynamic system for choosing y-tick
	values, to avoid overlaps and too-close tick labels in high-mass
	SUSY models.

2011-03-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Version 1.2.1: add more semantic and case-insensitive handling
	of format codes, and simultaneously avoid using the any() function
	which requires Python >= 2.5.

2011-02-27  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Version 1.2.0 (major version change due to interface changes and
	major new format functionality)

	* Change --outfile to --outname since multiple simultaneous
	formats are now supported and a single output name can't get all
	the file extensions correct.

	* Add EPS and PNG formats, and allow all (apart from TeX fragment)
	formats to be produced with a single command.

	* Version 1.1.0

	* Improving the newly-fixed HERWIG <-> PDG particle ID translation
	with a pair of functions, pdgid2herwigid and herwigid2pdgid, which
	are publicly available in the pyslha API.

	* Enabling simultaneous rendering of multiple input files.

	* Adding repr() implementations for the pyslha objects.

2011-02-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding some more LHA spectrum files to the collection for
	testing.

	* Removed make-plots output support... TikZ is just nicer and more
	widely supported, and I've not been bothering to test with
	make-plots anymore. It's there in the version history if anyone's
	interested!

	* Removing the --show-gravitino argument from slhaplot: I see no
	reason to treat gravitinos specially and clutter the UI, so if the
	gravitino is there, we plot it! Until we supply a
	user-customization hook for the particle display details, removing
	the gravitino will have to be done by hacking the TeX (or
	slhaplot) source.

	* Version 1.0.8

	* Adding non-SUSY HERWIG IDHW <-> PDGID particle ID code mappings.

	* Protecting plotter against unknown particles in decay spec.

2011-02-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Bump version to 1.0.7

	* Accept percentage args for --br

	readSpcFile to readSLHAFile

2010-08-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>
