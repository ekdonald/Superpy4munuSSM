    "description": "A process involving a chain decay of a BSM particle into another BSM particle and a SM particle. Corresponds to a Higgs::predictions::ChainDecayProcess. The process is defined by a list of production modes `p` for the mother particle, the type of the chain decay, and a list of decay modes `d` for the daughter particle. The rate is obtained as the sum over all possible combinations of `p` and `d`.\n The examples show:\n\n 1. the process `p p -> H2 -> Z H1 -> Z gamgam` for a mother particle `H1` and a daughter particle `H2`\n 2. the process `p p -> W-+ H+- ->  W-+ W+- H -> W-+ W+- bb` for a charged mother particle `H+-` and a neutral daughter particle `H`.",
